            <b>The Old English Period</b>, also known as the
            <b>Anglo-Saxon period</b>, includes all literature written during
            the Anglo-Saxon period of Britain. The majority of surviving works
            were written during the last three centuries of the era. The end of
            this period is marked by the Norman Conquest of 1066.
          </p>
          <p>
            This period spawned largely out of necessity, as there was a lack of
            Latin literacy after the Danish invasions, so a significant part of
            the population was unable to read Latin works.
            <b>King Alfred the Great</b>, the king of the southern Anglo-Saxon
            kingdom of Wessex from 871 to 899, noticed that many Englishmen were
            able to read Old English but were unable to read Latin. Thus, he
            proposed that students would first learn Old English.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a shockingly low amount of surviving works, there being
            only 3,037 texts, adding up to about 3 million words.

                Old English is the earliest form of the English language. It
                takes strong influence from Latin, borrowing many words. The
                language developed from Germanic dialects spoken by invaders in
                the 5th and 6th centuries. While Middle English is generally
                understandable in the modern day, it is far more difficult to
                understand the words and syntax of Old English. As a language,
                it was in use until the Norman conquest, when for a short time,
                French became the primary means of written communication.
              </p>
              <p>
                As stated previously, Old English is strongly influenced by
                Latin. As Britain was formerly occupied by the Romans prior to
                this period, and aristocrats may have continued to use the
                language for communication, a significant portion of Old English
                vocabulary is borrowed from Latin. Additionally, once
                <b>Saint Augustine</b> arrived, monk influence increased the
                amount of Latin that got interspliced with the language. A
                tactic that would be used was creating compound words, combining
                multiple Germanic pieces to represent the meaning of a Latin
                word.

            <i>Caedmon's Hymn</i> is the earliest example of a poem written in
            English. It was originally an oral hymn composed by a cowherd named
            Caedmon. Later, it was put into writing by a monk named Bede. It has
            the style of 4-beat lines consistent with other English poetry.
